# nvim-nvchad-conf
This repository contains my personal (And probably very bad) Neovim config using NvChad.
It currently only supports C/C++ and LaTeX.
This repository may be considered a fork of NvChad.

### Requirements
Full LaTeX support is only available through [TexLab](https://github.com/latex-lsp/texlab).
If you prefer other solutions or language servers for LaTeX or other languages, feel free to fork, issue PR or create an issue.
